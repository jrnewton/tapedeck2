# tapedeck2

This is a new version of http://tapedeck.us.

## TODO
- [ ] capture existing mp3 and m3u files
- [ ] capture live streams
- [ ] plugin to capture existing archived shows from my favorite radio stations
- [ ] recordings must be shareable ala "anyone with this link can access"
- [ ] playback GUI with offline support and background play on IOS (Eg doesn't shut off when you lock your phone)
- [ ] data storage via google drive so I can own the files from the beginning.  What about metadata?
